# Final Azure Deployment Fix

## Problem Solved!
The issue was that Azure runs `npm install --production` which skips devDependencies, but our built `dist/index.js` had import references to Vite packages.

## Solution Applied:
Created a simplified `server.js` that:
- Uses CommonJS (require) instead of ESM imports
- Doesn't reference any Vite packages
- Serves the static React app from `dist/public`
- Works with production dependencies only

## Next Steps:

1. **Commit and push the changes:**
```bash
git add server.js
git commit -m "Fix: Simplified server.js to avoid Vite dependencies in production"
git push origin main
```

2. **The deployment should work automatically** via GitHub Actions

3. **If needed, manually update the startup command:**
```bash
az webapp config set \
  --name valor-assist-service \
  --resource-group valor-assist-rg \
  --startup-file "node server.js"
```

## What This Fixes:
✅ No more "Cannot find package '@vitejs/plugin-react'" errors  
✅ Works with `npm install --production`  
✅ Serves the React app correctly  
✅ Runs on port 8080 as Azure expects  

Your app should be live at: https://valor-assist-service.azurewebsites.net within minutes!
